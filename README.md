### Hi; wonderful weather we're having

- ðŸ‘» I'm the tech lead for [Arachne Digital](https://arachne.digital).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building Arachne's cyber-threat-intel capabilities.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning chess.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to get in touch with me about:
  - Junior-software-engineer career advice
  - Anything Arachne Digital related
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenine-carron/).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once did a user-demo and noticed I left a squirrel icon as a temporary button (which I was meant to have removed before the demo). Thankfully my user was humorously receptive to it. Now, if you see any squirrels in my work, it is my own personal easter-egg.

### Hi; wonderful weather we're having

- 👻 I'm the tech lead for [Arachne Digital](https://arachne.digital).
- 🔭 I’m currently building Arachne's cyber-threat-intel capabilities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++.
- 💬 Ask me about your cyber-threat-intel needs and if Arachne can help you.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenine-carron/).
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once did a user-demo and noticed I left a squirrel icon as a temporary button (which I was meant to have removed before the demo). Thankfully my user was humorously receptive to it. Now, if you see any squirrels in my work, it is my own personal easter-egg.
